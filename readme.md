# Advent of Code solutions - [Join here](https://adventofcode.com/)

Here is where I'll be posting my solutions to advent of code.
I'll try to post them every day as I do them and in different languages at some point.

I've challenged myself to perform the challenges in `Malbolge` after I've solved them.
I'll include it when I make them :D

For the easier problems I will likely not include equivalent code in other languages.
I might add a readme but I'm pretty sure no one will see it anyway.

> Note on time complexity: I started measuring the efficiency of my code on the first day, however, at least for the easy problems that have solutions which complete in reasonable time, I stopped doing that since it has no impact in any way. I might do them for the later problems, depending on whether the solution benefits from it :D
